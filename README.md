#### Programming Technologies: PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Html
#### Framework: Laravel, Bootstrap
#### IDE and tools: Php Storm, MySQL workbench, GitHub
#### Deployment: Heroku and AWS

Created a web application in PHP using Laravel application framework that serve as a custom Social media feed site. An administrative back-end area, the basic structure (i.e. users, posts, themes) of a website can be dynamically created and modified by only authorized users with the appropriate permissions. The additions and changes to the siteâ€™s administrative structure will all be stored in the custom MySQL databases that will create to support the Social Media Feed site.

### Front-end
A front-end site area used bootstrap for design which will dynamically display posts based on the structure stored in the database. The front-end site will be viewable by all users including guests, but users can register and on subsequent visits log in to be able to contribute and make some changes to feed content.
For the deployment I used Heroku and AWS student associate database, work is committed and pushed to GitHub after completing tasks. By doing this project I implement the learnings of larval such how to create and use model, view, controller. Moreover, php artisan tinker was very helpful where I ran various database queries.
